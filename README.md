💻 Technologies Used

The application is a full-stack project divided into two main components:

Frontend Stack (User Interface)

    React: The core library for building the user interface.

    Vite: Used as the fast development server and build tool.

    Chakra UI: Provides a simple, modular, and accessible component library for styling and interface components.

    React Router: Handles declarative routing and navigation within the Single Page Application (SPA).

Backend Stack (API and Data Persistence)

    Node.js & Express: Node.js is the runtime environment, and Express is the minimal, flexible framework used to build the RESTful API.

    MongoDB: The chosen document-based NoSQL database for flexible data storage.

    Mongoose: Serves as the Object Data Modeling (ODM) library, providing a schema-based solution to model application data for MongoDB.
